<p>I start by thinking about my taste in art, what styles, colors, ideas, objects I like to see portrayed in art. Then I like to think about the stories that can come out of artwork, the idea, the emotion, or expression. Do I want to portray comfort? Do I want to create a moment, a page out of a story to visualize to a viewer? I think a root of my artwork comes from the fact that I need an “outlet” in my own life. I find comfort in expressing myself in various cryptic styles of art. It is like having a secret that only I know about, I like weaving in my own thoughts and then watching something else naturally unravel along with it. Physically, I draw vague shapes. I never start drawing the perimeter of an object, always the center is the first step. For example, if I were to draw an apple, I would draw a circle first. I proceed to get incredibly close to my artwork, and then drastically back away and squint at my piece to figure out the balance in my artwork. This repetitive process creates something always unexpected, as a child I always got frustrated that something did not look exactly like it did in my head, a common complaint I always heard from others as well. Though it is comforting to relate to- the secret isnt achieving such a skill that avoids the error of something unexpected, it is to accept and grow off of the result. 
	I think it is my energy, my stamina in creating art work. I also think it is overcoming the challenge of digital art all together- I physically paint. The wall that I am hitting is “my cup being half - full” rather than acknowledge the new idea of creating overall. Definitely have been living a “one step forward two steps back” type of situation with digital art.</p>

<p>My inspiration was originally rooted in a rather dark dramatic assumption that children exposed to technology at an early age has less creativity "It Fades Away and Becomes a Fantasy" as I was making this project I realized that maybe creativity does not get smudged out when exposed to the big screens, but maybe it is when they are stripped of "tools". I turn emotions into artwork- and like emotions, you reflect and realize that what was felt before as one emotion may have been misinterpreted and now perceived as different. I like to look at my artwork like that- feeling one thing in one moment and then drastically change to another with style, color, portrayal, all of it!&nbsp;

The things I think I still have a struggle with is patience, to be completely honest, I am used to the idea of painting a million different dots and creating a million different shades of the same color by hand. What gets me is the clicking everything is precise and pixelated. I admire the variety of skill it takes to create digital art just like it does with physical art- its a whole new environment. It doesn't feel hot and cold but rather when you are trying a different piece of food, its fun and different just not what you are used to. </p>

<p>I believe that film can capture the actions differently than in a painting. When you capture a moment in a painting- there is only one “frame” of knowledge for the viewer to perceive. The interest is attracted to the mystery. I believe that in film, there is deeper meaning to an event when it is done in film, the setting, the person, the moment is established and the intention is revealed by deeper decisions and choices that take place in the film that are made by the main characters. My idea for this film was to strike a chord of womanhood in the film. At first it was to capture the idea of doing your makeup, the idea of “dress up” is to pretend, hide, accentuate? And then it actually, by surprise, warped into self-identity, relationships and womanhood. It was a comforting feeling I get when painting, I pick the wrong color, or wrong angle, or even listen to a different song while I paint and create something even more exciting and detailed than I could imagine.  
I learned the end result with editing videos is a lot like painting, you try and hope for the best with a lot of “maybe this will work” in the middle. I learned more versions of patience while I endlessly clicked and clicked away and added and deleted movie scenes over and over again and created something I am pretty satisfied with. I would like to in the future perhaps use music of some sort, or even work better on blending color/ lighting together. I think I got the point across, however, though my enthusiasm carried me far enough I think if I had more skill I would have.</p>

<p> Gonna start right off the bat by saying that I am not too proud of how my moose toy came out. I am still proud of my effort, however, I feel like if you let a ten-year-old mess around with Blender, this is what they would create after ten minutes. But maybe that's the truth, my familiarity with Blender, 3D modeling, is very new, my ability to achieve the ideas in my head is not as mature as my painting skills are and I am grateful for the new lesson's that every form of art never fails to give.  I wanted to keep the color brief, a natural to match the toy moose. I wanted to emphasize on the moose's eyes along with the vague antlers on the head. I was excited to find each typical shape to follow the idea of sculpting the moose- cones! Of all things was the easiest shape to use went a long way. I bit off more than I could chew with the particular object- should have stuck with either another donut, or mug, something, anything more simple than a toy moose- however, I am proud of the challenge anyways. It is a favorite moment of mine that I have every morning, I wake up, look towards my window sill and see two small toy moose looking at eachother- one of those "his and hers" decorations my boyfriend and I have. Its a sweet simple gesture that I wanted to recreate, not the best but I had fun the whole time. I showed my boyfriend afterwards, he laughed with me as it is a bit of a failed attempt at the real thing- and it made the moment even better. </p>
